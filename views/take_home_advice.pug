    p Kittens love to play with everything, that is why it's so important to kitty prep your house. Organize computer cables, dont leave small things that a  kiteen would easily swallow lying around. Things that might fall and break, because a kitten will climb everywhere it can.

    p Set up the kitten's room with a bed, scratching post, litter box, food and water dishes, and toys. Put the kitten in the room and let her explore a bit while you are still with her. Then leave her alone for a short time so she can become comfortable in the new surroundings. At first, the kitten may hide. Try to coax her out to comfort her. Don't try to push too fast, though. She will gradually get used to you. New kittens are won over with food, but donâ€™t give her too many treats! Make sure to visit your vet with the kitten before allowing her to meet your other pets. Be sure to keep a separate litter box, food and water bowls even after the introduction until you are sure the cats will share
